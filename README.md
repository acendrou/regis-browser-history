# regis-browser-history
A simple web extension / browser add-on to save your browsing history.

When the title of a tab change or when a tab is created, the extension saves the date, the url and the title. Every 20 minutes or when another window is opened and closed, the data is written on disk. The file is of JSON format, its name is current date, and it is saved in a folder called "regis-browser-history" placed in your default downloads folder. You could also trigger that saving behaviour by clicking the button called "Download". You also can stop or start the app and view it status in the popup accessed in the toolbar.

Works only and tested on Mozilla Firefox(v89+).
